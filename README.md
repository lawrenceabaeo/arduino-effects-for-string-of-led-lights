## NOTES:
* July 2015
I wanted to upload this code to github in case I forget about it on my hard drive.
I forgot what some of the modes really look like and my method naming isn't as 
descriptive as I thought it was. Hopefully I'll get around to playing with this 
project again. 

## What is this?
This is code for an Arduino UNO (or equivalents). The code responds to short and long
button presses. A short button press will activate the LEDs in some manner, such 
as sequentially lighting the LEDs until all the LEDs are fully lit. A long button
press will change the current mode (switching for example, from a simple fading in 
of all LEDs to a mode that 'moves' the leds back and forth along the led chain). 

## Why did you make this? 
I wanted to make an LED string lightsaber. The programming and prototyping was 
fun, but after seeing how much time, effort and money would be needed to scale 
the project into a 'blade', I decided NOT to pursue the lightsaber project. I 
decided that if I wanted an LED string lightsaber, I would save and 
purchase one from a 'sabersmith' that specializes in this kind of saber, 
or purchase a high power LED lightsaber (the kind where there is a high power 
LED in the hilt lighting the length of the tube as oppposed to a string of LEDs 
living inside the tube). 

## What about the hardware?
I forgot about a LOT of the details of the setup. I took some pictures, but they 
aren't as informative as I thought. If I get a chance to play with the Arduino
again I will have to do something better to document the battery, resistors, etc.

## License
Feel free to copy and adapt this code (much of this code came from online resources
anyway). As noted in the hardware section above, I forgot much of the details about
the hardware setup.
